**_The and code and results currently in this repository refer solely the first year of the MSSP, as originally submitted to the conference. Between the original submission and the resubmission deadline, the data for the second year became available and we have "upgraded" our analyses. Please get back in a week or two and we will have uploaded the new code and new complete set of results covering the first two years. Thank you for your patience._**  
  
**_As part of our commitment to transparency, the full set of results available here also includes the exact number of claims, per data source (i.e. per data file from the CMS Virtual Research Data Center) that were ignored due to the possibility of existance of large outliers, as well as the threshold for the cost of an individual claim that delimited the top 0.01th percentile (which is the definition we used for "potential outliers"). The availability of these details, unfortunately, was not mentioned in the paper itself._**

Reading and reusing source code can become so much easier after a quick voice talk with the original authors of the code -- we will be glad to help.
